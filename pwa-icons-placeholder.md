# PWA Icons

For a complete PWA, you'll need to create several icon files in different sizes. These icons should be placed in an `/icons` directory in your web app.

## Required Icon Sizes

Create the following icons for your Solar Clock PWA:

1. `icon-72x72.png` (72×72 pixels)
2. `icon-96x96.png` (96×96 pixels)
3. `icon-128x128.png` (128×128 pixels)
4. `icon-144x144.png` (144×144 pixels)
5. `icon-152x152.png` (152×152 pixels)
6. `icon-192x192.png` (192×192 pixels)
7. `icon-384x384.png` (384×384 pixels)
8. `icon-512x512.png` (512×512 pixels)
9. `apple-icon-180.png` (180×180 pixels)
10. `favicon-32x32.png` (32×32 pixels)
11. `favicon-16x16.png` (16×16 pixels)

## Icon Design Guidelines

For the Solar Clock PWA, consider using:

1. A simple clock face design
2. The sun symbol to represent solar time
3. A color scheme matching your app (blue and yellow tones)
4. Clean, simple design that's recognizable at small sizes

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:

1. Graphics software like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or Figma
2. Online PWA icon generators
3. Icon creation services

## Installation

After creating the icons:

1. Create an `/icons` directory in your project folder
2. Place all icon files in this directory
3. Ensure the filenames match exactly those referenced in the manifest.json and HTML files

The app will automatically use these icons when installed as a PWA.
